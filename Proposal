Ok apologies, I have never used GitHub, but upon reaching out to Jackson, he requested I make a request here in GitHub.

I'd like to propose that weselldoges.com be included on Dogecoin.com as a way to obtain Dogecoin.  One of the biggest 
barriers to entry for newcomers is obtaining (buying) Dogecoin.  People new to cryptos aren't familiar enough with
exchanges and get confused when instructed to buy Bitcoin from Coinbase/etc., send to Cryptsy/etc., trade for Doge, and
so on.  

WeSellDoges.com is as simple as checking out via PayPal.  We have sold more than 1 BILLION Dogecoin since opening in April.

I'd encourage and appreciate consideration of including it somewhere on Dogecoin.com for "how to get Doge".

Thanks,
Greg
